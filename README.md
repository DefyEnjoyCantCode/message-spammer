# message-spammer
A simple script that spams letters from text in a given interval.

This can be adjusted to fit your needs, if you'd like.

# How-To-Run
Install both libraries *pyautogui* and *time*.

You can edit the text in the beemovie.txt, but don't change the name or python will be angre.

The script gives you 2 seconds to move over to the text area.

# Suggested-Preferences

In my personal opinion, if you want to run the script, I recommend doing it in *Python Shell*, you can kill the script at any time, and it's easier.

# Making-Changes-To-The-Script

Honestly, I don't mind. Feel free to adjust the script to what you'd like.
